# Indian General Elections Analysis 🗳️

## Introduction
India, as one of the largest democratic nations in the world, conducts parliamentary elections (Lok Sabha elections) approximately every 5 years. With over 500 parliamentary constituencies, the data related to these elections is extensive. In this project, we explore political trends in India using a comprehensive dataset containing election data of 2014, 2019 & 2024 (excluding by-elections).

## Dataset Overview 📊
Our dataset includes essential aspects such as:
- **PC Name:** Refers to the name of the parliamentary constituency (PC).
- **No:** Represents a unique identifier or serial number associated with each constituency.
- **Type:** Indicates the type of constituency (e.g., general, reserved for specific categories).
- **State:** Specifies the state to which the constituency belongs.
- **Winning Candidate:** The candidate who secured the highest number of votes in a particular constituency.
- **Party:** Indicates the political party affiliation of the winning candidate.
- **Electors:** The total number of eligible voters in the constituency.
- **Votes:** The actual number of votes received by each candidate.
- **Turnout:** Represents the voter turnout percentage (number of votes cast relative to the total number of eligible voters).
- **Margin:** The difference in votes between the winning candidate and the runner-up.
- **Margin %:** The margin expressed as a percentage of the total votes cast.

## Key Findings 📈

   - BJP (Bhartiya Janata Party) secured the highest vote share with 51.93% (282 seats).
   - INC (Indian National Congress) followed with 8.1% (44 seats).
   - Others collectively accounted for 39.96% (216 seats).

2. **2019 Election:**
   - BJP increased its majority to 55.8% (304 seats).
   - INC also slightly increased to 9.58% (52 seats).
   - Others decreased to 34.62% (188 seats).

3. **2024 Election:**
   - BJP secured the highest vote share with a slight decrease compared to 2019: 44.2% (240 seats).
   - INC increased slightly to 18% (99 seats).
   - Others also increased to 37.57% (204 seats).
